        <h2 class="subheader">Web Accessibility</h2>
        <h3>By Clare Swensen</h3>
            <p>By creating accessibility on the web, we are working to remove barriers that inhibit a user from engaging with a website. The most obvious group to consider when it comes to accessibility are persons with disabilities, but we must not limit our thinking. Designers and developers must consider all users; disabled, nondisabled, the elderly, people with varying computer skills, individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds, or even a population in a rural area with limited bandwidth. The goal is to create equal opportunity and equal access among all users. </p>
            <p>The World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines  (WCAG) was created to provide a reference when implementing accessibility features. The guidelines are conveyed through four main principles; perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. These principles outline accessibility in a more conceptual way for designers, so they must think about both technical accessibility and usability. </p>
            <p>There are many benefits to providing accessibility on your site. The W3C states,  “Case studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach, among other benefits.” Ultimately, by creating accessibility on your website you are improving the user experience and providing inclusivity. From a business perspective, this could help in avoiding lawsuits of discrimination. This occurred in the case against Domino’s where a blind man sued because he was unable to order a pizza from their website using a screen reader.</p>
            <p>The Justice Department has not created specifics on what is legally required in relation to ADA and web properties. Other than federal agencies, which are required to follow WCAG, developers are implementing strictly voluntarily. Without strict regulation, many websites have failed to meet basic accessibility standards. WebAIM conducts an annual web accessibility evaluation of the homepages for the top one million websites. They reported, “Across the one million home pages, 51,379,694 distinct accessibility errors were detected—an average of 51.4 errors per page. Also, “ 97.4% of home pages had detectable WCAG 2 failures.” They describe most of the errors to stem from 6 main categories; low contrast text, missing alternative text for images, missing input labels, empty links, missing document language, and empty buttons. If developers were focused on simply addressing these issues, the accessibility of the web would greatly improve. </p>
            <p>As students moving into the industry, we can be part of a new generation that prioritizes accessibility by developing good habits. Although it is impossible to remove all barriers, we can focus on meeting the needs of the audiences we most expect to use our site. In the future there may even be an automated approach to web accessibility.</p>
