          <h3>What Is Social Media Optimization (SMO)?</h3>
            <p>Social media optimization is a way of utilizing social media platforms to drive traffic to your site. A well thought out strategy will increase your business’s online presence and build a community and reputation around your brand. Although this is a way to drive traffic to your site through sources other than search engines, SMO is also a key factor in your search engine optimization (SEO). When content is liked or shared it can increase a site’s ranking.</p>
              
          <h3>Why Social Media?</h3>
            <p>Social media is a way for your business to engage with your audience and increase your business reach. According to a study done by Dataportal, “There are 4.33 billion social media users around the world at the start of 2021, equating to more than 55 percent of the total global population.” Not only does social media reach a wide audience, it allows businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns by analyzing their metrics. Essentially you can fine tune and adjust your content according to what works best for your business. In addition, by building a community around your business, your audience can potentially be your best marketing tool.</p>
              
          <h3>How to Strategize Social Media?</h3>
            <p>Creating social media accounts is not enough, the goal is to create engagement with your audience. Determine who your audience is and where they would best find your content. Once you have established your focus, track and analyze what works best. Not only does your business need to optimize where the content exists, but also the quality of the content. This is a very valuable marketing tool, you want to make sure your audience is engaging and responding positively to your content. According to a Hubspot survey, “Over 20% of respondents said that they would unfollow a brand on both Facebook and Twitter if they believed the content was boring or repetitive.” Ideally, the audience transforms into a community and support around your brand. We want them to believe in the products or services. If a user shares a link or reposts content, they are essentially performing “word of mouth” advertising. Intentional hashtags, providing resources, rewarding engagement, and creating shareable content are all simple elements to creating a well tailored social media presence. The internet world is also very dynamic, don't be afraid to try new things, analyze results and make changes to constantly improve your strategy.</p>
